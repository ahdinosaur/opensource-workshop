# computers are taking over

- gadgets are being replaced by computers
  - airplane is a computer with wings
  - car is computer with wheels
- everyone here probably interacts with tens, hundreds, thousands, or more computers a day
- all computers are capable of an infinite number of tasks
  - general computation

# proprietary software

a program is "proprietary software" if the software is licensed under exclusive legal right of the copyright holder and users are given the right to use the software only under certain conditions, and restricted from other uses, such as modification, sharing, studying, redistribution

- artificially limits your ability to control the computers you own.
- incentivizes profit instead of people

!NOTES

- shelfware

# proprietary software

    "if you share with your neighbor, you are a pirate. if you want any changes, beg us to make them."

Xbox's are computers, iPhone's are computers, but neither allow you to run software that is not approved by Microsoft or Apple. it's like buying a radio and only having 3 channels, even though the radio is capable of thousands of channels, and getting arrested for flipping to a 4th channel.

# free software

a program is "free software" if the program's users have the four essential freedoms: 

1. freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
2. freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.
3. freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
4. freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. by doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes.

# free software

    "free as in speech, not as in beer"

the free software movement, under the GNU Project, rewrote all the programs necessary for general computation as free software.

# open source

open source is a rebranding of the free software movement, aimed at advocating the pragmatic advantages over the moral motivations. 

!NOTES

was successful in creating a non-trivial economy of people who deal with open source software

- the majority of smartphone OS's (except iPhone) and servers is open source.
- huge open source desktop landscape, but isn't used by the majority.

# what is the advantage?

    "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"

open source provides a way for anybody to take direct action in the tools they use by offering their skills. this results in tools that are cheaper, have fewer problems, and overall are more in the interest of people instead of profit.

# Linux

Linux is the name of the general computation engine built and assembled by the open source community. there are many distributions of Linux aimed at a variety of users, each capable of using different window managers and package managers.

## my recommendations

- easy => ubuntu with unity
- medium => debian with xfce
- hard => arch linux with awesome

!NOTES

the rabbit hole may contain worlds of adventure within

!SLIDE left

- "app store" => "package manager" (been around for decades in linux)
- web browser => firefox and google chrome
- microsoft word, office => libreoffice
- iTunes => clementine, amarok, aqualung, ...
- media playback => vlc
- adobe photoshop, image editing => gimp
- adobe illustrator => inkscape
- 3d modeling => blender
- video editing => openshot, kdenlive, LiVES, Avidemux, Cinelerra, ...
- blogging => wordpress
- website => drupal
- programming languages => python, clojure, lua, ...

# open source economy

the peaceful revolution happening right now is the creation of an open source economy

- everyone scatches their own itch, incentives change from profit to people
- development in collaboration with the community is cheaper
- all designs, blueprints, codes are freely available, so producing goods is free (if digital) or at fair labor price (if through a producer)

# basic computer literacy

# computer tips

- seeing the computer for what it is: an infinite-purpose device.
- computers aren't magic, they are highly deterministic
  - protip: only difference between "computer people" and others is that "computer people" Google all their problems until they find a solution

# the power of abstraction

1. magnetized atoms on a spinning metallic disk represent 0's and 1's.
2. 0's and 1's (binary) represent any number (decimal or any base)
3. numbers represent data and instructions
4. data can take many forms: text, music, images, etc
5. data can be composed within itself, as in the case of a website that contains all of the above

!SLIDE

# what does a computer compute?

```python
>>> 1 + 3
4
>>> a = 1
>>> a + 3
4
```
